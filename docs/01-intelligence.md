# Module 1: Learning from First Principles

## 1.1 What is Intelligence?

### The Fundamental Question
What does it mean to "learn"? Intelligence is often described as the ability to **recognize patterns**, **make predictions**, and **adapt to new information**. But how do we define this in mathematical and computational terms?

- **Human Learning**: Humans learn by observing, reasoning, and generalizing from experience.
- **Machine Learning**: Machines learn by mapping inputs to outputs through mathematical models.

In this module, weâ€™ll break down intelligence into its core components and lay the groundwork for machine learning **without shortcuts or black-box abstractions**.

## 1.2 The Essence of Learning
At its core, learning is about **function approximation**. Given a set of inputs \(X\) and outputs \(Y\), we seek a function \(f\) such that:
\[ Y \approx f(X) \]

### Key Questions:
- How do we define an optimal function \(f\)?
- How do we measure whether \(f\) is "good"?
- How does a model improve its function approximation over time?

We will explore these questions using simple mathematical concepts before introducing machine learning models.

## 1.3 Why Traditional Programming Fails for Learning Tasks
Traditional programming relies on explicit instructions:
```python
if condition:
    do_something()
else:
    do_something_else()
```
But what happens when the patterns are **too complex** to be manually coded? Examples include:
- Recognizing faces in images
- Translating languages
- Detecting fraud in transactions

Machine learning **replaces explicit rules with models that learn patterns from data**.

## 1.4 Learning as Function Approximation
To build intuition, consider a simple **linear function approximation**:
\[ y = mx + b \]
Where:
- \( x \) is the input
- \( y \) is the output
- \( m \) (slope) and \( b \) (intercept) are parameters learned from data

We'll implement this in the next section using Python.
