# First Principles Machine Learning

## 🚀 Learn ML from First Principles

Welcome to **First Principles Machine Learning**! This open-source project is designed to teach Machine Learning (ML) by **deriving everything from scratch**—no shortcuts, no black boxes, just a deep understanding of how ML works.

## 📖 What You'll Learn
- **Core mathematical foundations** of ML
- **Building neural networks from scratch** (without TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- **Intuitive optimization & generalization techniques**
- **Fundamental ML algorithms** implemented in pure Python
- **Real-world applications** using first-principles thinking

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/first-principles-ml.git
cd first-principles-ml
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
We keep dependencies minimal—just NumPy and Matplotlib:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

### 3️⃣ Run Jupyter Notebooks
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```
